# IsaacSim_RL_test
I'm testing functionality of the isaacSim and IsaacLab for RL


downloaded the zip file from website
installed isaacSim 
had to unzip in folder C:\isaacsim directly.

no installation only run the isaac selector.bat file and open the GUI

assets downloadable from the menu for usage offline
downloaded Go2,  Go1, spot robot

=============
for RL training had to install IsaacLab
cloned it from git repository
there is an executable file inside for handling the installation of RL frameworks
==============
I reinstalled a new conda version on my laptop
created ann venv for the isaaclab with python=3.11 so there would be no dependancy issue
then continued the installation of rl-games framework
